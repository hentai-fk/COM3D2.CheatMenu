## Why can't I edit this stat?
It's for your own good. Editing some the stats can cause you to miss or jump important scenes and events, or just cause all sorts of nastier issues. You're allowed to edit what is safe and what is not pointless. If you had something more specific in mind, you might want to also check the scripts in CMI that let you use all the poses or other non-stat related stuff.
